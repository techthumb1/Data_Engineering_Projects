# Data Engineering Projects

This repository is the base for a collection of projects related to the process of data engineering. The projects are organized in a way that they can be used as a template for other projects. The projects are organized in the following way:

- `data` - contains the data used for the project
- `docs` - contains the documentation for the project
- `src` - contains the source code for the project
- `tests` - contains the tests for the project

## Projects

- [Project 1](./project1/README.md) - This project is a template for a project that uses a database to store data.
- [Project 2](./project2/README.md) - This project is a template for a project that uses a database to store data and a message queue to process data.
- [Project 3](./project3/README.md) - This project is a template for a project that uses a database to store data and a message queue to process data. The project also uses a web server to provide an API for the data.
- [Project 4](./project4/README.md) - This project is a template for a project that uses a database to store data and a message queue to process data. The project also uses a web server to provide an API for the data. The project also uses a web server to provide a web interface for the data.

## The Tech Stack

The full tech stack that will be in use for this project is:

- [API Layer](https://www.fastapi.com) - FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- [ML Layer](https://www.docker.com/) - Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. (Python, SQL, REST endpoints, etc.)
- [Configuration Layer](https://www.hydra.cc/) - Hydra is a framework for building configuration systems. It is designed to be flexible, powerful, and easy to use.(https://www.terraform.io/) - Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. Users define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON. (https://www.metaflow.org/) - Metaflow is a Python library for building and managing data science projects. It provides a framework for building data science workflows, and a runtime for executing these workflows on AWS Batch, AWS Step Functions, and locally.
- [Logging/Testing Layer](wandb.ai) - Weights & Biases is a tool for tracking machine learning experiments. It helps you log hyperparameters and metrics in your training script, visualize performance as you train, compare runs and share results.(greatexpectations.io) - Great Expectations is an open source Python library for validating, documenting, and profiling data. Expectations are assertions or invariants about your data. They can be used to ensure that your data meets certain characteristics, or to detect when it does not.
-[ETL Layer](https://www.airflow.apache.org/) - Apache Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. (https://www.prefect.io/) - Prefect is a workflow automation platform that allows you to build, schedule, and monitor data pipelines and machine learning workflows. (https://www.kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Kedro is an open-source Python framework for building reproducible, maintainable and modular data science code. It is designed to help you build a data pipeline that is: modular, reusable, testable, and version-controlled. (https://www.airflow.apache.org/) - Apache Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. (https://www.plsqldev.com/) - PL/SQL Developer is a free Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that boosts productivity and simplifies database development tasks for Oracle developers. (https://www.udfplus.com/) - UDFPlus is a free tool for Oracle developers that allows you to create, edit, and debug PL/SQL code.
- [Data Layer](https://www.postgresql.org/) - PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. It was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the Ingres database developed at the University of California, Berkeley.
- - AWS RDS

-[CI/CD Layer](https://www.dvc.org/) - DVC is a version control system for machine learning projects. It is designed to handle large files and multiple users working on the same project. (https://www.gitlab.com/) - GitLab is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git-repository manager providing wiki, issue-tracking and continuous integration and deployment pipeline features, using an open-source license, developed by GitLab Inc.
- [Deployment](https:www.awsec2.com) - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.
- - AWS EC2/ECB
- - AWS SageMaker
- - AWS ECR
- [R & D](https://www.gcp.com) - Google Cloud Platform, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, file storage, and YouTube. Alongside a set of management tools, it provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics and machine learning.
